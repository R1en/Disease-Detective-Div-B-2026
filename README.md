## 🚀 Major Updates (v6.0 - National Level Edition)

This release upgrades the application to a "National Level" preparation resource:

*   **Professional Grammar Audit:** Over 300 quiz questions and scenarios have been professionally edited for tone, clarity, and precision (e.g., "ate" → "consumed", "sick" → "symptomatic").
*   **Mega Scenarios:** Added deep-branching, multi-step scenarios (Potluck Panic, Wedding Crasher, High Seas Hazard) that mimic real-world outbreak investigations with time/budget constraints.
*   **Enhanced Quiz Bank:** Questions now feature rich HTML formatting, data tables, and detailed feedback to mirror the complexity of National exams.
*   **Improved UI:** Formalized language and cleaner presentation across all interactive modules.
